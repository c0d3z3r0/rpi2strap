# rpi2strap for Raspberry Pi 2

## What is it?
rpi2strap is a script for installing Debian GNU/Linux Jessie 8.0 armhf to a sd card. You will get real Debian, not raspbian!

## Why?
Just because I *hate* downloading big sd card images a dd'ing them onto my sd cards.

## Is it ready to use?
No. It will work more or less but it is not complete, yet. I will make some changes in the next days.

## How to use it
./rpi2strap /dev/[your sdcard]

## Warnings
Please check that the config.txt (look inside my script) fits your needs. It hast HDMI/DVI and overclocking enabled. Graphics memory is set to the smallest possible value because I only use it as a server.

## Am I allowed to modify and share it?
Yes, of course but please keep the author name where it is :-)
